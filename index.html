<h2>about me</h2>
<section>
  <p>Hi, I'm Ariel Mordoch. Currently, I'm working at 
    <a href="https://stc.arcfield.com">Strategic Technology Consulting (STC)</a>
    as a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) consultant. Before my time at
    STC, I served on Boeing's Enterprise MBSE team for 3 years, advising and 
    steering defense and commerical programs throughout the company. My expertise
    includes requirements management, modeling & sim, digital thread, systems
    architecture, enterprise architecture, digital thread, tool integration, and 
    more. I am a Cameo tool & API expert and have extensive experience
    developing custom plugins to improve modeling productivity and integrate
    external tools.
    In 2020, I earned my B.S. in BS in Aerospace Engineering from 
    <a href="https://gatech.edu">Georiga Tech</a>. I was born in Tel Aviv, 
    Israel and moved to Atlanta, GA when I was 4 years old. I also hold an FAA 
    Private Pilot Certificate -- to which I added an 
    Instrument Airplane rating in 2024 -- and speak English and Hebrew fluently,
    German at a B1 level, and Spanish at an A2 level.</p>
