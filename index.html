  <h2>about me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Ariel Mordoch. I'm a junior at Georgia Tech studying
    Aerospace Engineering and I recently completed my first co-op
    rotation at Honda Aircraft Company. I was
    born in Tel Aviv, Israel and moved to Atlanta, GA when I
    was 4 years old. I am an active brother of AEPi and a member of the aerospace honor
    fraternity SGT. I also hold an FAA Private Pilot Certificate
    and speak English and Hebrew fluently, German at a B1 level, and
    French at an A1 level.</p>

  <h2>experience</h2>
  <p><strong>Honda Aircraft Company</strong>, MRB Systems Co-Op, Greensboro, NC<br /><em>(May 2018 - August
      2018)</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>At Honda, I designed and drafted a new part for a design improvement, and performed a tolerance analysis
      on the existing design.
      I also wrote MATLAB/Python software to generate a report identifying high failure rate parts.
      Along the way, I collaborated with design engineers to close design change requests and address part failure
      rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>hobbies & interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>My favorite thing to do is flying.</strong> I love being
      behind the controls of an airplane. I generally fly
      Piper Cherokees.
    </li>
    <li><strong>I've been following and playing soccer since the World Cup in 2014.</strong>
      I'm a fan of the german team Borussia Dortmund (and Atlanta United, too). Heja BVB!
    </li>
    <li><strong>I also enjoy gaming</strong>. You can usually find me playing KSP,
      Witcher 3, Rocket League, ...and FIFA (of course).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Programming.</strong> My history with programming stretches back to
      my early days in high school. I very much enjoy coding and translating concepts
      I learn in class into code. In fact, the majority of my college application were
      actually for CS. Over the years, I have done a couple projects which
      were generally applications of knowledge I gleaned during my courses.
      You can take a peek at <a href="https://github.com/amordoch">my Github.</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Photography and graphic design have also historically been subjects I'm very interested
        in.</strong>
      Give me a DSLR and I'll be occupied for days on end. I might put up some of my shots here in the future.
      As for graphic design: modern, minimalist design has always piqued my interest, and in nearly every project
      I've done which involves some graphic, I've used some aspect of minimalism. Of all its aspects, though,
      I'm probably the most partial to modern typography. You can make nearly anything look great with good fonts.
      I've tried to reflect both these intersts by keeping it simple with the design of this site.

  <h2>projects</h2>
  <h4>This Website</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This portfolio-style website, coded completely from scratch. No
      bootstrap, no jQuery, no frameworks. The &quot;hard&quot; way.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Student Goverment Association (SGA)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://united.gatech.edu">united.gatech.edu</a> Website Redesign
      <ul>
        <li>For this project, I lead a team of 4 in redesigning Georgia Techâ€™s United
          website (the campus portal for mental health and
          related issues) in the style of other GT websites.</li>
        <li>Throughout, I collaborated with the GT Mental Health Student Coalition,
          organized weekly meetings with team members, worked directly on
          and oversaw progress on the project.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SGA Website Refresh Project
      <ul>
        <li>I collaboratively rebuilt the SGA graduate and
          undergraduate website from the ground up using Drupal and attended weekly meetings to discuss progress
          and resolve technical issues.</li>
