<h2>about me</h2>
<section>
  <p>Hi, I'm Ariel Mordoch. Currently, I'm working at Boeing doing model-based
    systems engineering (MBSE), after recently graduating from Georgia Tech
    with a BS in Aerospace Engineering. I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel and moved
    to Atlanta, GA when I was 4 years old. In undergrad, I was a brother of AEPi
    and a member of the aerospace honor fraternity SGT. I also hold an FAA
    Private Pilot Certificate and speak English and Hebrew fluently, German at a
    B1 level, and Spanish at an A2 level.</p>

  <p><strong>Honda Aircraft Company</strong></p>
  Flight Sciences Co-Op, Greensboro, NC, January 2019 - May 2019
  <ul>
    <li>During my second rotation at Honda, I developed and validated a simulation
      of a spoiler failure during landing/takeoff. Separately, I created and
      analyzed a deep stall model using wind tunnel data. I additionally worked
      with flight test engineers to assess the performance of the flight controls.

  MRB Systems Co-Op, Greensboro, NC, May 2018 - August 2018
  <ul>
    <li>At Honda, I designed and drafted a new part for a design improvement, and performed a tolerance analysis
      on the existing design.
      I also wrote MATLAB/Python software to generate a report identifying high failure rate parts.
      Along the way, I collaborated with design engineers to close design change requests and address part failure
      rates.</li>

<h2>hobbies & interests</h2>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>My favorite thing to do is flying.</strong> I love being
      behind the controls of an airplane. I generally fly
      Piper Cherokees.
    </li>
    <li><strong>I've been following and playing soccer since the World Cup in 2014.</strong>
      I'm a fan of the german team Borussia Dortmund (and Atlanta United, too). Heja BVB!
    </li>
    <li><strong>I also enjoy gaming</strong>. You can usually find me playing KSP,
      Witcher 3, Rocket League, ...and FIFA (of course).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Programming.</strong> My history with programming stretches back to
      my early days in high school. I very much enjoy coding and translating concepts
      I learn in class into code. In fact, the majority of my college application were
      actually for CS. Over the years, I have done a couple projects which
      were generally applications of knowledge I gleaned during my courses.
      You can take a peek at <a href="https://github.com/amordoch">my Github.</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Photography and graphic design have also historically been subjects I'm very interested
        in.</strong>
      Give me a DSLR and I'll be occupied for days on end. I might put up some of my shots here in the future.
      As for graphic design: modern, minimalist design has always piqued my interest, and in nearly every project
      I've done which involves some graphic, I've used some aspect of minimalism. Of all its aspects, though,
      I'm probably the most partial to modern typography. You can make nearly anything look great with good fonts.
      I've tried to reflect both these intersts by keeping it simple with the design of this site.

<h2>projects</h2>
<section>
  <h4>Lunar Lava Tube Orbiter (Senior Design/Capstone)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>For my capstone project, I and a team of 8 developed a proposal to send
      a CubeSat to the moon and investage underground lava tubes (as a would-be
      part of the Artemis program). The satellite would discover and study lava
      tube formations using a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) adapted from the
      GPR on JAXA's KAGUYA spacecraft.
    </li>
    <li>We developed the system from Pre-phase A
      through &quot;Phase A&quot; (NASA lifecycle phases), developing mission
      objectives, a Science Traceability Matrix, top-level through subsystem
      requirements, and the mission architecture (including CONOPS).</li>
    <li>We also
      developed a solution architecture for the spacecraft, including a CAD model,
      COTS components, and science instruments adapted from the Japanese KAGUYA
      mission. For the solution architecture, I was responsible for the science
      payload, ADCS, CD&H, and Comms subsystems.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>This Website</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This portfolio-style website, which I designed completely from scratch.
    All the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was written by me. The website is built
    using Jekyll (Github Pages), with templates for each language.
    </li>
    <li>The &quot;backend&quot; is implemented using Flask (Python).</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Student Goverment Association (SGA)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://united.gatech.edu">united.gatech.edu</a> Website Redesign
      <ul>
        <li>For this project, I lead a team of 4 in redesigning Georgia Techâ€™s United
          website (the campus portal for mental health and
          related issues) in the style of other GT websites.</li>
        <li>Throughout, I collaborated with the GT Mental Health Student Coalition,
          organized weekly meetings with team members, worked directly on
          and oversaw progress on the project.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SGA Website Refresh Project
      <ul>
        <li>I collaboratively rebuilt the SGA graduate and
          undergraduate website from the ground up using Drupal and attended weekly meetings to discuss progress
          and resolve technical issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
